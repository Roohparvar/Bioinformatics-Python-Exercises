# Protein Sequence Analysis

This script performs various analyses on protein sequences provided in FASTA format. It calculates the following metrics for each sequence:

- **Protein Sequence**: The amino acid sequence itself.
- **Length of the Protein Sequence**: The total number of amino acids in the sequence.
- **Percentage of Each Amino Acid**: The proportion of each amino acid present in the sequence.
- **Molecular Weight of the Protein**: The total molecular weight of the protein, calculated in grams per mole (g/mol).

The script will print the protein sequence alongside all the calculated analysis results, providing a comprehensive overview of the protein's characteristics.
