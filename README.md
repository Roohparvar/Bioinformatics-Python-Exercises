# Bioinformatics Python Exercises

Welcome to the **Bioinformatics Python Exercises** repository! This collection consists of 10 simple Python exercises designed for students and beginners interested in bioinformatics. These exercises are perfect for anyone starting their journey into the world of bioinformatics and seeking to strengthen their Python programming skills with practical applications.

## Purpose

This repository provides a set of exercises that introduce fundamental concepts in both bioinformatics and Python programming. Each exercise is tailored to help learners build a solid foundation in writing Python code while solving real-world problems in bioinformatics.

## Structure

The repository contains 10 folders, each dedicated to a single exercise. Each folder includes:
- **Python scripts** for the specific exercise.
- A **README** file explaining the details of the exercise, including the problem description and instructions for solving it.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises cover a variety of topics and techniques commonly used in bioinformatics, including:
- **DNA Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing DNA sequences.
- **RNA Analysis**: Methods for studying RNA sequences.
- **Protein Analysis**: Approaches to analyze protein sequences.
- **Longest Common Substring**: Finding the longest common substring between sequences.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Identifying the longest subsequence present in both sequences.
- **Global Alignment**: Aligning sequences over their entire length.
- **Local Alignment**: Finding regions of similarity within sequences.
- **Protein Translator**: Converting nucleotide sequences to protein sequences.
- **Hamming Distance**: Calculating the difference between two strings of equal length.
- **Reverse Complement**: Finding the reverse complement of DNA sequences.

Each exercise is independent, allowing learners to tackle them one by one as they build their knowledge. For detailed explanations and problem descriptions, please refer to the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder.
