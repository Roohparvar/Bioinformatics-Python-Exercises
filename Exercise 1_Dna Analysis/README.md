# DNA Sequence Analysis

This script performs various analyses on DNA sequences provided in FASTA format. It calculates the following metrics for each sequence:

- **Length of the DNA sequence**: The total number of nucleotides in the sequence.
- **Percentage of each nucleotide**: The proportion of Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C) in the sequence.
- **GC Content**: The percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **AT Content**: The percentage of Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **AG Content**: The percentage of Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **GT Content**: The percentage of Guanine (G) and Thymine (T) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **AC Content**: The percentage of Adenine (A) and Cytosine (C) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **TC Content**: The percentage of Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) nucleotides in the sequence.
- **AT/GC Ratio**: The ratio of (A + T) to (G + C) in the sequence.

The script will print the DNA sequence itself alongside all the calculated analysis results, providing a comprehensive overview of the sequence's composition and characteristics.
