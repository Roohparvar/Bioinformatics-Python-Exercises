# RNA to Protein Translator

This script reads an RNA sequence from a FASTA file, processes it to remove header information, and translates the RNA sequence into a protein sequence based on the standard genetic code. The program also handles multi-line RNA sequences and recognizes stop codons.

## Features

- **Input**: Reads an RNA sequence from a FASTA file.
- **Multi-line Handling**: Processes multi-line RNA sequences seamlessly.
- **Translation**: Converts RNA sequences to corresponding protein sequences using the standard genetic code.
- **Stop Codon Recognition**: Identifies stop codons and terminates translation accordingly.

This script is essential for researchers and bioinformaticians involved in genomic studies, as it provides a straightforward way to translate RNA sequences into protein sequences, enabling further analysis and functional predictions.
