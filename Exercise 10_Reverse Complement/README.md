# Reverse Complement of DNA Sequences

This Python script reads a DNA sequence from a FASTA file and prints its reverse complement. It skips over any header lines in the FASTA file and only processes the actual sequence.

## Features

- **Input**: Reads a DNA sequence from a user-provided FASTA file.
- **Reverse Complement Calculation**: Computes and outputs the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
- **Nucleotide Handling**: Works with standard nucleotide characters (`A`, `T`, `C`, `G`).

This script is essential for molecular biology studies, allowing researchers to easily obtain the reverse complement of DNA sequences for various applications, such as primer design and sequence analysis.
