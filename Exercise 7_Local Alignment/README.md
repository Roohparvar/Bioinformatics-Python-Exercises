# Local Alignment of Sequences

This script performs a Local Alignment between two sequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The alignment maximizes the score based on user-provided values for match, mismatch, and gap penalties.

## Features

- **Input**: Reads two sequences from FASTA format files.
- **Custom Scoring**: Allows the user to input custom scores for match, mismatch, and gap penalties.
- **Local Alignment**: Performs local alignment of the two sequences.
- **Output**: Outputs the aligned sequences and the maximum alignment score.

This script is particularly useful for identifying regions of similarity between sequences, which can aid in functional prediction and evolutionary studies in bioinformatics.
