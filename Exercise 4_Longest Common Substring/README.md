# Longest Common Subsequence of Substring

This script finds the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two substrings provided in FASTA format. The script reads two files, each containing a sequence, and then calculates and displays the longest common subsequence between the two substrings.

## Features

- **Input**: Takes two separate substrings in FASTA format as input files.
- **Output**: Prints both substrings.
- **LCS Calculation**: Calculates the longest common subsequence between the two substrings using Dynamic Programming and displays the result.

The script provides a comprehensive analysis of the common subsequences shared between the two sequences, which can be useful in various bioinformatics applications, such as sequence alignment and evolutionary studies.
