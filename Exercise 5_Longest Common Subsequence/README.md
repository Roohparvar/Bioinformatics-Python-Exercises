# Longest Common Subsequence of Sequences

This script finds the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two sequences provided in FASTA format. The script reads two files, each containing a sequence, and then calculates and displays the longest common subsequence between the two sequences.

## Features

- **Input**: Takes two separate sequences in FASTA format as input files.
- **Output**: Prints both sequences.
- **LCS Calculation**: Calculates the longest common subsequence between the two sequences using Dynamic Programming and displays the result.

This script is useful for comparing genetic sequences, identifying similarities, and studying evolutionary relationships in bioinformatics.
